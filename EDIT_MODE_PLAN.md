# Character Sheet Edit Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the static D&D character sheet into a dynamic, editable character sheet builder with the following capabilities:
- Reordering and resizing blocks
- Adding items, sections, subsections
- Adding custom trackers
- Reordering and resizing everything
- Changing text in every component, including tooltips

## Current Status: **PLANNING PHASE** âœ…

## Architecture Overview

### Current State
- Single-file HTML application with CSS Grid layout
- Interactive elements: HP tracking, spell slot trackers, notes area
- LocalStorage persistence for user data

### Target State
- **Data Layer**: JSON-based configuration for all content
- **Render Engine**: Dynamic HTML generation from data model
- **Edit UI**: Toggle between view/edit modes with overlay controls
- **Enhanced State Management**: Save/load complex structural changes

- Safe import process with backup and validation
- Shareable character sheet files between users
- Data portability across devices and browsers

---

### **Phase 2: Dynamic Content**
**Timeline**: Week 4-5
**Status**: Not Started
**Complexity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add/remove list items (spells, abilities, equipment)
- [ ] Create new trackers with custom names and usage limits
- [ ] Implement content templates for different item types
- [ ] Add form controls for creating new content

#### Technical Requirements:
- Dynamic HTML generation for lists
- Template system for different content types
- Form UI for adding new items
- Enhanced data model for dynamic content

#### Deliverables:
- Users can add/remove spells, abilities, and equipment
- Custom tracker creation with configurable limits
- Persistent storage of dynamic content

---

### **Phase 3: Structure Changes**
**Timeline**: Week 6-9
**Status**: Not Started
**Complexity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium-High

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add new sections and subsections
- [ ] Implement simple reordering within containers
- [ ] Create content type selection (text vs tracker vs list)
- [ ] Build section templates and management

#### Technical Requirements:
- Section template system
- Drag-and-drop within containers
- Content type abstraction
- Nested data structure management

#### Deliverables:
- Users can add custom sections
- Reorder items within existing sections
- Choose content types for new sections

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Layout**
**Timeline**: Week 10-13+
**Status**: Not Started
**Complexity**: ðŸ”´ High

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Drag-and-drop for major tile reordering
- [ ] Block resizing (changing CSS Grid spans)
- [ ] Layout templates and presets
- [ ] Advanced grid manipulation tools

#### Technical Requirements:
- Complex drag-and-drop with grid constraints
- CSS Grid span manipulation
- Layout validation and constraints
- Visual grid editing tools

#### Deliverables:
- Full layout customization
- Resize tiles and change grid layout
- Save/load custom layouts
- Layout presets for different character types

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Data Model Evolution
The application will evolve from hardcoded HTML elements to a data-driven approach using JSON configuration. This will enable dynamic content generation and structural modifications.

### Future File Structure
As the application grows, consider modularizing into separate files for maintainability:
- Core application shell
- Data model definitions
- Rendering engine
- Edit functionality
- Enhanced persistence

---

## Development Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Minimal Disruption**: Add features without breaking existing functionality
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Existing content works, new features layer on top
3. **Incremental Testing**: Each change is immediately testable
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Get feedback after each major feature before proceeding

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing after each phase
- Preserve existing functionality
- Test data persistence across browser sessions
- Mobile responsiveness verification

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1:
- âœ… User can toggle edit mode
- âœ… All text content is editable and persists
- âœ… No regression in existing functionality

### Phase 1.5:
- âœ… User can export character sheet data as downloadable JSON file
- âœ… User can import character sheet data from valid JSON files
- âœ… Import process safely backs up existing data before applying changes
- âœ… Cross-device compatibility confirmed

### Phase 2:
- âœ… User can add/remove list items
- âœ… Custom trackers work correctly
- âœ… All changes persist across sessions

### Phase 3:
- âœ… User can create custom sections
- âœ… Simple reordering works smoothly
- âœ… Content types are intuitive

### Phase 4:
- âœ… Full layout customization available
- âœ… Drag-and-drop is smooth and intuitive
- âœ… Layout presets provide good starting points

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk:
- Text editing (Phase 1)
- Import/export functionality (Phase 1.5)
- Basic add/remove functionality (Phase 2)

### Medium Risk:
- File validation and error handling
- Drag-and-drop implementation
- Data model migration
- Mobile touch interactions

### High Risk:
- CSS Grid manipulation
- Complex state management
- Performance with large character sheets

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: âœ… Phase 1 implementation completed
2. **This Week**: Begin Phase 1.5 - Implement import/export functionality
3. **Week 3**: Add data validation and cross-device testing
4. **Week 4**: User feedback and refinement before Phase 2
